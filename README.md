Hello there!, long time no see, it's almost a month since I did my last commit from this project, I've decided to take a little pause to enjoy my vacations from university, and also I was bussy working hard in a overdue project from my internship, but it's already over, so, I wanna resume my project starting with some SQL queries, stay attuned for the next updates!
